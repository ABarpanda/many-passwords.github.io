# Contribution Guidelines
**Many passwords** is powered by the community, so feel free to contribute in any way you can to help us!
# How you can help
* Submit pull requests with new default passwords (see guidelines below) or snippet updates (notes, typos, listing in alphabetical order, etc).
* Open issues for things you want to see added, modified or help out with existing issues.
# Ground rules
Passwords are stored as a CSV file.

In order for the CSV file to be displayed correctly by Github, follow the scheme below:  
```Vendor,Model,Version,Access Type,Username,PASSWORD,Privileges,Notes```

Example:  
```3COM,Wireless AP,ANY,Multi,admin,comcomcom,Admin,Works on all 3com wireless APs```  
will be displayed:

You can speed up our work by updating the number of default passwords in the [readme](https://github.com/nothing3F/many-passwords/blob/main/README.md) file.
