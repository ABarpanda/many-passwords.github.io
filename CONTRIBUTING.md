# Ground rules
Passwords are stored as a CSV file.    
In order for the CSV file to be displayed correctly by GITHUB, follow the scheme below:  
```Vendor,Model,Version,Access Type,Username,PASSWORD,Privileges,Notes```
Example:  
```3COM,Wireless AP,ANY,Multi,admin,comcomcom,Admin,Works on all 3com wireless APs```
will be displayed:  
3COM,Wireless AP,ANY,Multi,admin,comcomcom,Admin,Works on all 3com wireless APs
